This react app is based on the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes, most of the assets and colors are the one we can find in the game. 
For the API of this app I'm the one from the CA1 (https://github.com/FiveTTTTT/FehApiRepo/)
The main page FeHeroes read all the heroes from the database and display them all the heroes on this page are links to access all the informations of one hero. On this page it's also possible to create a new hero. A new hero has no image of him so he has a default image called unknown. To create a new hero he has to have a name a title an statistics.
It is also possible to search for an hero by hes name.
The page FehSingle will take the id of one hero in order to display its informations. On this page it's also possible to update this hero by clicking on the edit button, an hero can only be updated if at least one the informations is modified.
On FehSingle it is also possible to delete the hero by clicking on the delete button and confirming.
